# GuessTheNumber

This project uses the random module in Python. 
The program will first randomly generate an unknown number. 
The user needs to guess what that number is. 
If the guess is wrong, the program returns an indication why it is wrong, i.e. the number is too high or too low.
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication will appear.
